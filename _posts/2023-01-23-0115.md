On a cosmic scale it's easy to overlook small things. Like people. I think so many civilizations are so used to the idea that a person is essentially inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. Countless empires have reigned and fallen without a single person impacting even their system of stars in a meaningful way. Sure, eventually some societies get there, but it’s a process, one that uses collective and compounding progress to build upon knowledge and reach. Upon capacity. Enough strength to affect a position of power in your universe is inconceivable to a single Finite mind, much less so in the span of less than eons. One person can’t make something happen quickly. Gods do. Machines do. Not people. 

Usually.
