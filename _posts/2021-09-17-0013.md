The planet’s glow was bright and fluorescent against the dark nebulous sky, a magnificent view none of the crew was able to appreciate. The unending pings of all the distress signals on the console became background noise, realization setting in to the team. 

“That’s where three of the coalition’s ships vanished.”

“Sir, scans show seven separate distress signals.”

“Any special info associated with the beacons Eri?”

“None, Sir.”

The captain paced around the command center, his team silently running scans and handling preparations behind him. Would he willingly lead his crew into danger? No. He would however like to do his best to save those who need his help. What’s the least risk involved with doing the best they could here?

“Alright. Don, could you configure one of the drones with a biometrics scanner we have in the cargo bay?” 

“I don’t see why I couldn't, Sir.”

“Excellent, Eri, give me time stamps on each distress signal along with the approximate origin of each. Gull, once Don configures the recon drone I want you to fly down into orbit, I want extra power into defense. Get the anti magnetic shield array online, even if it means lowering power to life support systems. No surprises.”

The crew nodded and scrambled to do their jobs. The captain looked out onto the planet in front of them. “What secrets are you hiding?”
