“I’m worried about the safety of it all.” Brall paced around as he spoke. “Perhaps caution is better suited, a small army may be bet-”

“Enough.” Ki stood up. “You know it’s better if it’s just the two of us. Cel and I are a solid team.”

Brall narrowed his eyes. “Convince me then why I should possibly lose my daughter on a whim of yours that stealth is the better option?

“It is not yours to risk Brall. This is the path she chose. Deny her this and you lose her anyway.”

Brall sneered as he turned back, facing out of the window. *These fucking pulsers corrupting his own child. Despicable and abhorrent fuckers, they destroy everything they touch.* 

“Perhaps you feel as if I’ve ruined your legacy.” Ki opened the door to the chamber. “But to me it seems obvious that what you’ve built was unstable from the start. I hope you find a way to pick up the pieces once everything crumbles.”
