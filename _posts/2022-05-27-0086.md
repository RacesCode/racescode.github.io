*With my hand stretched out I can feel the drops of rain slowly dripping off the edge of the roof. The bars on my window restrict me but how bad can it be when I can feel the cool air, the morning crispness. Life here hasn't been fulfilling but it has taught me a lot.*

*Once I'm free I'll write to you again.*
