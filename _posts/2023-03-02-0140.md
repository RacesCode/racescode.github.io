“I just don’t like seeing you in this much pain.” Silvena held Nym’s cheek, “You worry me.” 

“Me too… I worry I’ll get there to only find a dead end.” 

“I wish things were different, Nym. This isn’t the life we wanted, we didn’t want to be out here playing rebels. I know things have been taken from us Nym – from humanity – but sometimes I just wish we could forget our roles in all this and appreciate the life we have. I know that’s wishful..”

“No, I do too. But that’s why we fight, Silv. That’s what this is all for. I want our vision to become reality, I want us to reach that crossroad. But this is where our perseverance matters most. I promise, it’s only a little further.” Nym held her hand in his own, “C’mon, I think Petyl has something for us.”
