Baz lit a candle in the darkness of his room, the soft light now washing over the parchment that sat littered over his desk. He sat down carefully, being mindful to minimize the sounds he was making, and began the arduous task of reading in dim wavering light. One at a time he slowly stacked the finished pages into a pile and slowly it grew until all the documents had been studied. He closed his eyes, committing as much as he could to memory. Could he really remember that much? What if there were parts that he skipped over or forgot? He tried to push away the thoughts, focus was needed. He constructed a room within his mind, fitting each page's contents into a separate box within it. He took a deep breath and paused a moment before taking the candle and setting the pages alight. The room was now bright, engulfed in color. Baz stared at the burning parchment before him, looking into the burning sun of flame, his emotions fell away. Becoming entranced by the fire, a name was the only thing left that sat in his mind, Nym Blas, his assassination target.
