"Oh Visia, what have I done to forsaken you? I have been an obedient servant under your watchful gaze, what more can I do to prove myself? How many more moons must I endure before I am granted your Gift?"

The stone idol of Visia remained as it was, just a statue. Wev sat in silence before it, tears of despair and frustration running down their cheeks. Why have they not yet been granted the Gift? They had long passed the age of Sight and yet still unseeing, bound to darkness. It was unnatural for someone of their age and devotion to spend their life without Visia's Blessing. They wiped their tears away and once again donned their blindfold, composure taking hold. They decided they would come back tomorrow to pray, today they had been too encumbered by their emotions, by their irritation and unfulfillment. The comfort in knowing it was only a matter of time was Wev's only solace. One day they would be granted the Sight. One day they would be able to see this world and truly thrive within its' beauty. One day could be soon. Or it could never come.
