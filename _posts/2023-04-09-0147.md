Petyl closed her notebook softly, another entry finished. It was exhausting. Everyone thought of her Sight as a gift, to her it was a burden. Her hand caressed the leather booklet, so many precious dreams recorded. So much of it riddled with self doubt. Dreams were impossible to fully catch, to fully memorize. She felt like an amateur forger blocking in shapes of a beautiful painting and missing the details, the strokes, the colors. The life of it. When she woke up every day she could feel the visions draining out of her head like there was a hole in the back of her skull. Maybe there was somewhere. 

She closed her eyes, seeing the last vestiges of those fragile scenes play out before her in imperfect memory and emotion. A girl trapped in a box on fire. A man with a severed shadow. A wielder of a blade surrounded by a perfect darkness. These images stood out from the rest today, a moment longer for each, a searing sunspot, each image burned. This was rare for her but not unfamiliar, there had been others before that had stayed frozen in memory. She bound her notebook in her favorite red ribbon and gently put it in her bag. 

Something bothered her about her most recent witness though, an inescapable dread that continued to creep up and spread over the images like a virulent corruption, darkened veins growing through them. 

Something was wrong with those scenes. Something unseen. An external presence beyond her own. 

*Something else was watching.*
