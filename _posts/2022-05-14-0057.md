*I have started making conversation with one of the guards. He often stays quiet or tells me to shut up but sometimes I've gotten him to respond. Every ounce of humanity he sees in me will be helpful. I don't know his name although I refer to him as Drag because of the medieval looking dragon tattoo on his neck. He seems to not mind the name. To chip away at peoples' emotions is like the slow cutting of these chains. It'll happen eventually.*
