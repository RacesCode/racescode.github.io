Fin took it, “Fin.” 

Jericho nodded and went back to cooking, he slipped his knife under one of the chops and flipped letting out a nice drawn out sizzle. “Not to pry, Fin, I can tell you’re a man who is inclined to his privacy.” Jericho said, another sizzle mixing with the last as he flipped over the other piece. “But I can’t help but notice you seem out of sorts out here in the grove.”

What could he say to that? Fin sat down on a rock near the fire, it was warm, a welcome feeling against the bitter cold. It wasn’t about trust, it was about the idea of burdening this man with his terrible truth — his problems — that bothered him. What entitled Fin to unload so much baggage unto this man? Nothing. He watched as Jericho took the meat off the cooking stone and onto a slab of wood to rest. 

“I’m out this far north because of a job,” Fin lied. “Farther north than I intended.. I’m a hunter by trade. I’m just on a bit of a deadline.” He sighed. What a mild way to put it. He had mostly told the truth, just without the imagery of a clock of death hanging above his head, ticking away, about to run out. 

Jericho chuckled, “Makes sense, I dabble in trapping myself.” He nodded towards the meat resting. “But only ever to get by, more of a forager if anything.” He cleaned his knife again. “What’s the job? What are you hunting I mean?”

Fin for a moment considered lying — occluding little tiny insignificant bits of the truth — again, diving further in and spinning more of his web. But the truth was he was looking for answers. When it came to his personal reasons he could muddle the truth, but when it came to the goal he simply didn’t have time to lie. He was going to die unless he found the creature he was looking for. He looked up to meet Jericho’s eyes, “Ever heard of the legend of the rothswip?”
