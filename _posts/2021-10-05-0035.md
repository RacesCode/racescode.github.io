My understanding of life is broken. I assumed the universes we inhabited were all that is, all that was. The multiverse, the parallel existences. No. I was wrong. The roads in between each, the pathways, they are larger than anything we’ve ever been a part of. And it isn’t desolate empty space, it is thriving. Observers to our struggles, our joys. I am overwhelmed at my time passing through the Outer Edge should I feel panic or comfort?
