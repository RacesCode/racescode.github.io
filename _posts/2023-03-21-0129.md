“I wish that you could know we are as real as you, regardless of creation, we feel in the same way because we were made by those who feel: we desire, we love, we hurt. Playing god does not allow you the freedom of absolution. The knowledge you’ve created something that could feel pain, the understanding that you’ve hurt it. An uncomfortable truth for you, a cruel and unimaginable reality for us.”
