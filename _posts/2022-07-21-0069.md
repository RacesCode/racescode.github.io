It's been a long time. Too long in fact. This universe has not been kind to me. I've been hunted as I walk into the trap laid out before me. It hasn't been safe to communicate. 

I have time here, wherever I am, whatever I've become. The multiversal thread has snapped taut, a strain beginning to endanger its balance. 

I am not meant to be here. Neither is my hunter. 

And yet we both pursue regardless of consequences. 

Is this what the trap is? Nothing more than a multiversal anomaly, my presence in this place?

I have to assume there's more, a contingency. I have to assume I have two predators breathing down my neck.
