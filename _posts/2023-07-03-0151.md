@everyone 
Ryn walked down a hallway of white marble, lined with doors passing left and right. The heavy stone doors and what lied beyond them did not intrigue her, she was there for what sat at the end of the too-square hallway that seemed to run down into infinity. She didn’t know what it was that sat at the end, merely that she needed it. Drawn to it, instinctively, like bugs to a light shining in the dark. She could feel the pressure of it on her mind, pulling. 

Something else. She felt pushing. 

Pushing was what it felt like at first but that wasn’t quite right. Something pressed on her mind, just as she was being drawn to the end of the hallway something else was being drawn to her. She hastened her step. The pressure rose. Faster, she ran down the hallway but it seemed to never end, doors flying by at her sides, everything became a rush. At some point she noticed the hallway turned from white to deep black, fading into darkness and void, the doors had become eyes, watching her as she pushed forward to the end, somehow faster and now slower than she ever had felt before. The more energy she tried to exert the heavier she felt. The eyes stared into her, pierced her. They knew. They knew what she was. What she was really running from. She didn’t want to know, she had pushed it away for a reason. She wanted to be at the end, to escape their soul wrenching gaze. As she neared the end of the hallway she felt the pressure mounting on her mind from behind. It was close. The eyes shifted, looking at whatever it was behind her, she watched their gaze slowly shift closer and closer to her until — 

Ryn awoke with a jump. Propping herself up on her elbows she took a minute to just breathe and reorient herself with the world. Her dreams had been rough. Nightmares seemed to come freely for her recently but she reasoned that out as fair, her last few days had been some of the most stressful and depressing of her life. Constant fear and uncertainty of plunging into the unknown. The mind was resilient but still needed rest from these things — waking rest — lest it continue forward under the assumption it was still in danger even in unconsciousness. Surely that was why she was having these dreams, why she’d felt eyes on her, heard voices. Paranoia plain and simple. An exhausted mind. 

She shook the dream off by getting up and surveying the immediate area around her hiding spot. She felt clumsy though as she did it, groggy from sleep, but she was still careful and deliberate. She still wasn’t very far away from the walls of the supposed Holdout. Not close enough to be in danger of being heard but enough away to feel like you could pinch someone between your fingers if you closed one eye like she used to do as a kid. If she could see them though, then they could see her. Better to be careful. She also didn’t know how well they patrolled the gnarled expanse that sprawled out before the Holdout, maybe it was only a matter of time before they did and she was found. Fortunately it was well overgrown everywhere out this far, the wild brush was her savior for once instead of her obstacle. 

Confident she hadn’t been discovered or exposed she got to work. There was plenty to do now that she had discovered this place but she started with rolling up her bed roll. Instincts she didn’t really consider that were instilled into her from a young age. She liked things being in order, packed, ready to go if you needed them. The feeling of needing something like a plate only to find it hadn’t been washed was among the most aggravating feelings to her, so she packed knowing wherever she would end up once the sun disappeared she’d be ready for it, or at least her bed would be.
