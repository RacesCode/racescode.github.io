There was a lot to understand about the systems that lay stranded within the veil. Looking back on it we don’t know how it contained the area of the galaxy it did and in the way that it did when our universe is supposed to be moving. Everything was moving at least. Some have guessed that the multiversal connection event froze this motion prior to the veil’s appearance, that merely joining our realms stopped universal expansion. I personally don’t know what to think. If given the opportunity I’d love to test this theory again but we both know that’s no longer possible.
