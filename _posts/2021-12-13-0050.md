I have arrived in the correct timeline, the right universe.. I hope. Not that it matters anymore. But It's a feeling I have, it's a different understanding of the space around me. It's *different* here. I am glad to be free of the Outer Edge. I do not yet know if I am whole after feeling what is beyond mortality and life maybe nothing feels the same. The portal I chose stripped my soul from me, and although it was put back in it's place I feel disembodied. I feel wrong. 

The senses I have are not my own. Something is hunting me still, through the portal, through the Outer Edge. I can see it's hatred, it's hunger.

As much as I would like to save the multiverse, I would also like to return home. 

Some other sense tells me that's not going to happen.
