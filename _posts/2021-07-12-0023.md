Sitting near a fire in the middle of the night was peaceful, the embers flying out and meeting with the darkness, the sounds of crackling fire, insects, and wildlife beginning to stir. Truly it would have been peaceful if one could appreciate it. Ryn held her face in her hands, physically she was at her limit, emotionally she was broken. For days she couldn’t shake the feeling she was being watched, ever since the presence of a disembodied voice spoke to her about her vague future. What kind of life was she living? She was living in between the impossible options of moving forward or back. It was either a slow isolated death in the wild or a quick end to the Seers. Had she given up everything to die? She looked at her small fire, its flame wavering, beginning to die. She straightened her posture, something caught her eye. A small dot, a light in the distance. Questions surfaced immediately. What is that? People? Can they see *my* fire? Am I in danger? Ryn stomped out her small fire as quickly as she could, grabbed her pack, and through the darkness of night began moving towards the light, guided by curiosity, desperation, and fear.
