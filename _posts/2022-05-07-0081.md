Riv couldn’t help but chuckle at the interaction, the man took advantage of him and his generosity but he didn’t mind. If someone was that desperate for food then so be it. It was the boldness of the fellow that stood out to him. He leaned back in his chair again going back to watch the groups shout and raise glasses to celebrate. You would think a province that focuses on food would be able to feed their own. Another disappointment. He caught the attention of a passing barmaid and she scuttled over. “Another ale please.” He dug around in his pocket for his money pouch. 

He couldn’t find it. 

He switched pockets, searching through all, patting his coat. He didn’t have it. He slammed the table startling the barmaid, she winced. He stood up, face red, scanning the crowd, the thief would be gone by now surely. He slammed the table again out of anger and went off into the night, resolute to find the thief named Pavel.
