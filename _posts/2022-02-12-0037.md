The room was dark, silhouettes blurred. Pavel fumbled with a match trying his best to light it, the humidity stopping him. The air was so damp he felt almost underwater. He pocketed the matches and resorted to feeling around with his hands. He ran his fingertips over several items and papers on the shelf in front of him, nothing texturally stood out to him. Metal is what he was looking for, gold or silver specifically, anything he could fence or pawn. Feeling the smooth cold surface of a trinket he stopped, bringing it as close to his face as he could he tried to see what it was. Useless. He stowed it away in his front pocket. Treasure hunting wasn’t as glamorous and fulfilling as the tales say. The only difference between a treasure hunter and a thief in most peoples’ eyes was if the owner of the treasure was alive or not and for how long. Pavel’s definition was more blurred these days. Survival trumped that of morals, having something to eat, somewhere to stay. Most times he had neither. He sighed, another night of poor looting. He grabbed a roll of what felt like parchment off the shelf and left, just wanting to take at least something.
