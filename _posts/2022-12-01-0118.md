Fellren frowned deeply, projecting his hateful gaze onto her. Rel understood why it was easier to stare at his boots. “I swear woman, if you didn’t pitch these wondrous meals well enough..” Sellira remained in her subservient posture, his words not having an effect on her. “Bah!” Fellren raised his hands and stalked away, barking orders at the chefs and bakers under his management, Rel guessed he was looking for someone more cathartic to push his hate and frustration towards. 

Sellira exhaled deeply, writing something on her notepad before scurrying out of the kitchen the way she came. Rel’s eyes narrowed, watching her go. He needed her list. In it were schedules and notes, all the inner workings of everyone’s schedules down to the minute. It would take him months to learn what he needed to without it – hundreds of people worked in this forsaken place – and he didn’t have the time. This was the fastest route, his target had to be killed before the week was up. But for now he watched her go while standing in line, gloved hands still holding a silver platter and cloche, waiting for instructions like a servant would.
