“Have we always been ruled over by the gods? Even before the veil?”

“Yes, dear. In the time of stars so existed the gods. Our history is a long one, inextricably woven together.”

“So when did the gods come?”

“The truth, child, has been distorted over the years. I can’t give you answers I know to be true.. but I believe they came from our people, ascended into the stars. Whatever power they possess I cannot determine whether it was through attainment or bestowal. Regardless, they retain it… and so they are gods.”

“If we had that power we could be gods too?”

“That’s enough stories for tonight, Aarand. You have a big day tomorrow, get some rest.”
