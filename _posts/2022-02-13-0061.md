“Look in the skies above us. Do you see them? There. They see us. Their vision spreads out further than comprehension. They decide for us. Is it fair? Is it just? No. I don’t believe so. I believe they lost the humanity they had when they left the ground. They’re something else now. No.. not gods. Machines. Are we too.. machines? If they decide our will then are we different? What will could they possess? Are we so far disconnected that we cannot understand their design, their path? I believe that to be true. But we are different. We are not machines. Don’t forget the emotion you feel beating in your chest. The life you breathe. It’s not theirs to give. 

It’s yours to protect.”
