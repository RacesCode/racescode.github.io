At the sound of the sirens everything stopped. The snow falling froze in air, the animals became statues. Ryn stood motionless, straining to do so. The Seers came quickly, their laser cameras examining the area around her. Ryn had trained for this, but standing perfectly still wasn't easy. The precision you had to have to fool the probes was astounding, and precision she had. A Seer swept over to where she stood and scanned her. She couldn't allow herself to panic, she just had to trust in her ability. She wished she could close her eyes, to scream, to disappear. The green light exuding from it pierced her eye but she remained still, no flinch. The Seer moved away with the others and eventually out of sight. The sirens blared once more. The snow continued to fall. Ryn fell to her knees, tears streaming down her face. Overcome with emotion she wept. It was part fear, part anxiety, but overwhelmingly happiness. She finally had hope. A chance that she could escape this place.
