What I still can't figure out after all this time.. who is behind this? I fear finding out might be worse than ignorance in this situation. Could I live with the knowledge of betrayal? But could I as well live with the knowledge that *anyone* I know could've been behind this?

Many questions to ask myself as the time nears.
