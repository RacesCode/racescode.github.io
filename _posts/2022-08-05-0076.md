A message beeped on my receiver when approaching the planet. A new communication from the transmitter hasn't been sent in weeks, just the slow stream of the same data over and over. But this was new. 
'You brought **it** here'
I knew as soon as I read it what 'it' was. The being from the Outer Edge. 
Was I really it's prey? 
Or was I leading the thing right to it?
