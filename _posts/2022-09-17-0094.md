Y’lyat felt the familiar discomfort of his consciousness being ripped from his body. A distinct and sharp pain radiated through his soul. There were lesser beings who thought that pain was linked to the vessel they inhabited. Once Y’lyat had thought the same. The pain of transference felt eternal, though the process was usually brief. His consciousness snapped and linked with his Infinite form, the soul crushing agony ceasing immediately. He opened his eyes to see the others around the table open theirs at the same moment. A meeting had been called.
