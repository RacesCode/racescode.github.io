*We have a measurement for the size of the multiverse. Years ago we theorized that each universe was expanding judging from the space between stars over time. However a new theory was proven. The space we inhabit is of a finite size infinitely expanding in on itself recursively. Our universe inhabits at least a 4D space which allows it this property. Our 3D perception makes it hard to fathom or understand. Measuring the distance of transmission for the anomaly through falloff calculations we were able to assume it connects to a place outside of the multiverse.*
