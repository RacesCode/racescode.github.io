In the light it was easy to see the scars and emotional aging on the man, years and years of struggle, very few struggles of which were ever successful in his favor. And yet he still stood, here and now, facing the impossible odds before him, ready to fight. How many times had the Gods brought down their wrath upon him? Upon his family, his home, his people? How much strife were his efforts worth for those around him? But people followed him still despite all this. Maybe it was the glow cast by twilight or the way he stood above them, maybe it was his posture in the face of hopelessness, standing tall and spreading belief and bravery without a word, but just for a moment it was easy to catch a glimmer of him being a leader to follow.
