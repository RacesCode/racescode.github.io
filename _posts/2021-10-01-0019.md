The lights were on, the subsystems seemed to have activated but the captain wasn’t quite sure how many major systems had been powered, the backup battery station could only provide so much. He tapped his ear receiver, no power connection. He turned to Eri, “We have less than four minutes, bridge, now.” 

The two ran out of the room, the captain leading to the control room. *Where the fuck is everyone else?*

“Captain.. something is wrong.. with this sector.” Eri was struggling to catch her breath while keeping up. “The.. distress signals.. they’re originating from our ship.. in the future.”

“What the fuck does that even mean?”

“Sir.. I don’t know.”

The bridge was empty when they rushed in, Gull and Don were still missing. The captain rushed to the power panel station, unsurprisingly the batteries weren’t providing much, only a few cells. He tapped the screen, sliding up the auxiliary communication. He touched his earpiece once again, “Report.” No response. Captain turned to Eri, she shrugged. He spoke once more into comms, “If you can hear me we have just over three minutes of power remaining, we’re hacked still, probably. Get the fuck to the bridge, disable the hack.” He paused for a moment, thinking in silence, then allocated the remaining power to the weapons.
