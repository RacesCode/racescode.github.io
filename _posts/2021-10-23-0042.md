I chose a portal. The souls rejoicing gave me hope that I would go to a good place. My ethereal being melted away when I stepped through, consciousness turning into liquid memories. I felt the energy of my choice bring my soul into life again. I was free of the Outer Edge, I have arrived in a new place. The multiverse is cruel, and I pray this universe I have found myself in is not hell.
