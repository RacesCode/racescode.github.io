The connection is stronger now, closing my eyes I can see what it does. I try not to strengthen the bond, but every time I blink I see a moment, a frame of its perception. It doesn't see how we do, it senses. It knows. Within this vessel, as loosely as I am bound to it, my perception is still limited. The knowledge, the understanding I can feel whenever I see through this being threatens to fracture my soul, to unravel it. 
I fear my time here is limited.
