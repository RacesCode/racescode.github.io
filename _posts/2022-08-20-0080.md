The discontinuation of transmission has no doubt affected the lives of an incalculable amount of people across the multiverse. Sometimes throughout all of this I like to sit and reason with myself about why I've come so far. Why I've done all that I have to find myself here in the midst of the storm. Some moments I decide maybe it isn't worth it. Some I do. 
In the face of it all right now I don't know how to feel. 
Staring into the heart of Aether's blue light is a surreal feeling, where I am, the stakes of it all. It should make it feel more real. 
It doesn't.
