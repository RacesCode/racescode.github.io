Seeing the structure in front of me is breathtaking. Though I used to work on relaying messages between the multiverses I had never been tasked with a hardware problem, I had never seen the transmitter with my own eyes. I don't know how this behemoth was built nor how it was designed but the magnificence of it goes beyond my understanding. 
That's been happening a lot lately on this journey it seems.
