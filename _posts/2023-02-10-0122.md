*I heard a legend about a planet that was cut off from its star. I felt bad for the people that lived there. It must’ve been so cold and lonely after that, drifting along through the void of space on that little rock. If they survived through that anyway, I’m sure they could use some warmth, I’m sure we all could. The sky.. the air.. it’s colder than before. That’s not just me right?*
