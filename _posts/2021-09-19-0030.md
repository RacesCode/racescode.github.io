The captain had never run so fast in his life, his suit flashlight barely allowing the way ahead of him to be illuminated enough to see. The familiar corridors seemed foreign in the midst of panic. Finally getting to the engine room door only to find the door controller subsystem power was also offline. He opened a hatch on the wall, pulling a hefty switch for the manual override on this specific entrance. He could hear the rust of the gears as the door struggled to slide open. He squeezed his way through, running to the other side of the engine room, another powerless door standing in his way. Eri came up behind him shouting something, he couldn’t hear, all of his strength was going into pulling the second switch down. The door slid open easier than the last, allowing the captain into the backup battery room. *We’re not going down that easy.*
