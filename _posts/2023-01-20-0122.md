No stars were out tonight, bad sign. They say the stars were guides, without them you traveled alone. Ryn felt alone, though she trudged through the unkempt brush with her soul alight. There was a real possibility she wouldn’t have to feel empty for much longer. She could still barely glimpse the light in the distance, it looked like a small fire, far away and hard to tell, but in her mind it might as well have been a beacon shining and cutting through the night sky with the way it shone into her heart. Seeing that little speck of wavering light represented everything. 
It was hope.
