Fin was a master hunter, he understood the forests more so perhaps than many of the creatures that lived in them, his whole life dedicated to the craft. There was a certain gift he had, whether it be an extreme eye for detail or a very accurate and high focus memory, he used it for tracking, and he did it extremely well. He could point out breaks in twigs and leaves, the outlines of the tracks of animals in the dirt, he saw the paths clearly, he could envision how animals walked through each area, how they interacted with the environment just upon seeing it. This induced paranoia to some degree. If he could see it surely others could too? Someone could follow him quite easily, as he could others. Constantly he would double back, switch paths, and cross up and down waterways as much as he could to dissuade theoretical pursuers. He wasn’t sure if he honestly believed someone was ever following him, but he liked to be certain no one had the chance. This however usually made progress slow during expeditions, time that would be going to waste. So as Fin traveled further north he found himself letting go of his old restrictive habits, it only made him more nervous. He had to bring up the point that it didn’t matter at the end if he was dead, too slow to find anything substantial enough to save his life, so on he pushed with more than fears of death crowding his mind.
