The corridor induced a hazy and dizzy feeling. It felt impossibly long, the sides felt as if they were closing in. Irie knew it was all in their head, she grounded herself and kept pushing forward. One door stood at the very end, otherwise the hallway was empty and barren. Soft blue light seeped under the doorway and onto the stone floor. The door seemed to stretch further away as Irie closed the gap. She stopped. *What sort of purgatory had she found herself in? Maybe the laws of the last world aren’t relevant here, maybe this place has new rules.* She closed her eyes and walked forward, imagining the door getting closer. Maybe imagery made reality malleable? She opened her eyes to see the door stretched far away, seeming even further. *Was she stupid?* She put her face in her hands in frustration. *Don’t give up yet. Try things.* She turned around, her back now facing the door, and took a few steps backward. She bumped into something almost immediately and stopped. Turning around she stood in front of that damned door. *There are more tricks to this place than she thought.* She grabbed the knob and twisted. 

She walked through the door into another hallway. It looked the same. *Is this the same hallway?* Irie turned around to see the door she had just walked through gone, looking back forward she saw the same door with the blue glow and the golden knob stretching far away into oblivion.
