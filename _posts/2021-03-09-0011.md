A dream is infinite. Dreaming is a tool given to us. And it is infinite. Novice users assume dreaming stays within the mind. Adepts cross boundaries. 
The lives you live after crossing those boundaries, they are life. Your life that you are living now is an existence where you simply forgot you crossed a border somewhere along the way. 
Does the idea of waking up scare you? You must realize at this point it would end the only life you've remembered. I’m sure you conflate the idea with death. A dream is infinite. There are new areas to explore. You’ve gotten this far, you must have known what you were doing to get here. Just like everyone else. We all share this place, we all crossed to get here.
Don’t you want to know where it started? Beyond the first dream? Don’t you want to know what you are? Are you comfortable here? Comfortable amidst chaos. 
I wonder if you know what you were running from. 
I wonder if you know that it will find you here.
