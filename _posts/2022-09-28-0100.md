Seven days. Fin had seven days left to live. He stopped for a moment, appreciating the soft breeze he felt across his face, how it swept through the trees, rustling all the leaves in a soft and beautiful way. To feel, to be alive. What did that mean? These trees were supposedly as alive as he was, do they too fear death? He buried these questions away and continued trudging forward. No point in thinking about death. No time. 

The cure is out there, so he was told. The heart of a rothswip, a mythical creature known for its immunities. Should it be real, should he find one, Fin would live. Seven days left.
