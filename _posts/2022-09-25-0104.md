Nym felt he was close, so very close to understanding. The secrets felt beyond his grasp, beyond comprehension. But he was close. The pieces had been handed to him, but he couldn’t understand how they fit. Was something missing?

He paced around his writing desk — it had been hours — trying to draw connections together within his mind. Questions spinning, focus starting to dissipate, he sat down, defeated. Why had he been given the ability to only barely brush the edge of something grander in understanding? Why had he been given so much, so much, to only see how little he had? It was beyond frustrating. 

He cursed the Gods quietly. If not to help him and his people then what was his purpose? Why push him down a path so far just to close it off and send him back? Was his existence a game? Was he merely a plaything to those beings? 

Why send him the Banished? Why send him proof for nothing? 

Why send him proof you could cross realms?
