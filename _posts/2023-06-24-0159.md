Another notification beep stole my attention, a message.

```Come planetside. They will find you.```

My shaky hands held the controls of the small craft, unable to move, wrought by indecision.  I was in the middle of three unknown entities and as far as I knew I was the target of them all. I didn’t have time to figure out the traps that were being set. I had to take a chance somewhere.

I swung the ship towards Fifteen and accelerated, engaging the boosters. There was no time left. I could feel that the consciousness from Xeno had found me and while I couldn’t see that being from the Outer Edge on the sector map I did see the green blip that had entered only a moment ago. It was on an interception trajectory.
