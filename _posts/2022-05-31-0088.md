She blinked and found herself standing over a man on the ground lying in a puddle of blood. She was holding Nightglow, the blade was radiating a cloud of dark air, blood dripping off the edge into the crimson pool forming around the man below her. He was wearing white though it was hard to tell, most everything was stained red. A patch on his shoulder held an emblem made of three triangles overlaid, each slighter higher placed than the last, pointing upward. She blinked again and found herself back in front of the castle, Nightglow held in her hand as it had been in the vision. She dropped the blade, letting it fall, and stumbled back against the wall behind her, sliding to the ground. 

She had never seen the contents of that vision before. She couldnâ€™t comprehend what she just experienced. Confusion and fear taking hold she just closed her eyes and wept, the image of a dead man now burned into her mind.
