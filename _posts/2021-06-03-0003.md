“You are banished.”

There was only the briefest of silences before the crowd exploded with shouting and yelling in all different colorful manners. Confusion and anger. Some overjoyed and crying. 

Kyr stood in silence, processing his sentence. His stare was blank, his mouth slightly ajar. He looked catatonic. Everything around him seemed to be in slow motion. His mind wasn’t racing, he wasn’t thinking anything at all. Emptiness. 

Moments passed. The sounds around him were present but muted. He couldn’t really hear. He couldn’t feel. Internally he knew time was moving but he didn’t pay attention to it. More moments passed. And then a thought. 

Banished. What did that even mean? The word rang out in his head, reverberating. 

How can I be banished from a universe?
