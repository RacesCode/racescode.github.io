“What was life like before the veil?” 

“Honestly… I don’t know. Life seemed freer then. Humanity had spread out, uncaged. I’ve heard when you looked up in the sky above it was littered with lights. Stars. We visited them. We… people lived there.”

“Will life ever go back to the way it was?”

“No.”
