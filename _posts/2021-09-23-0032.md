“Excellent, Eri, give me time stamps on each distress signal along with the approximate origin of each.” Eri nodded and hurried off to her station. Pulling up the logs of each distress beacon and pulling TD data from each. Seven beacons total, it was a lot of data to pour through. Eri stopped for a moment, staring at her screen, a horrible realization slowly manifesting. *These distress signals, they were issued in one hour in the future from now.* The console wasn’t broken, no, but something was wrong. *How could this even be possible?* She checked the location of the beacons, as approximate as their coordinates would allow to check for any possible correlations with the ship’s AI. The beacon locations had changed since she last saw them. They were centered on their own ship. 

The ship’s screens all blared red in unison.
