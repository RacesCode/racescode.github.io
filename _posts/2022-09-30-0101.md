Rothswips by legend were very small rodent creatures, white in color, large ears, and that fabled elastic tail, a tail long enough such that when coiled could push the creature vast distances, not unlike a spring.

He leafed through his notebook as he walked through the woods, he’d collected several drawings of the creature from old books and sketches from supposed witnesses. The past few weeks the desperation had kicked in enough to chase down fairy tales like these. He had doubted or had evidence that the stories of the finwinch, the deities of Fenrel forest, and the reapers were falsified or just children’s tales. So that left the rothswip. Research had led him down this path, all he could do was hope it wasn’t a dead end.
