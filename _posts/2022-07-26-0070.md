The multiversal transmitter lies in a far away system clouded by a dark nebula. The energy needed to power the machine comes from the star at the center, a blue class B named Aether. While being extremely powerful, the star barely fuels it when only connecting to me, the energy needed to tie all the known multiverses into a knot is almost incomprehensible. Before it was moved it sat leeching the raw power off of a quasar at the center of a galaxy.
 While being moved to be so hidden and far away you'd think it impossible to find and yet the signal was sent to me directly, effectively coordinates, what it guaranteed is that no one *else* would find it. No accidents. Controlled. No help close by. 
My understanding of this situation is lacking but my choices are limited. I have take control of the transmitter myself.
