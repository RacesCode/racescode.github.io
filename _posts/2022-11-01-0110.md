Another night of fog. Wonderful. Perin sat on the high outer walls of Wintrel, legs dangling down over the streets below. It truly was a wonderful city, all things considered. Even through the middle of the night he could see people far beneath walking the cobbled roads, lights of taverns and shops illuminating the darkness, the sounds of carriage wheels rolling and grinding over paved stones. This kingdom never seemed to sleep. 

And yet, Wintrel seemed as if its eyes were never truly open to the happenings around it. 

There was so much to know.

Perin opened his little notebook and flitted through pages until he found an empty one and waited. Deep red colored words began scrawling themselves into the page on their own. 

‘The pulser has passed the divide’

Perin sighed, “You’d think a deity such as yourself would have better tools at their disposal to deal with such things.” 

The page remained as it was. 

“Well okay then, no room for that I suppose.” Perin stood atop the wall and turned away from the city to the forest covering the east. In the pervasive fog he could only see the edge of the trees, but he knew the woods sprawled out past the horizon, as far as one could see in an endless darkness. He closed the little notebook with a snap and pocketed it, “I really should receive more gratitude, I’d imagine other gods would respect their assassins a little more.” With that, Perin dropped off the wall into the darkness below.
