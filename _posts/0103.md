“Do you know where you are?”

The question was simple. It was short. Brint knew that much. Why was he having such trouble understanding? His eyes were losing focus.

“Do you know who you are?”

Brint blinked. “Brint.”

“Hm.” The man wrote something down. “What do you remember last?”
    
Brint sat for a time in silence, thinking, trying to think. His brow furrowed in concentration. He couldn’t understand the question. His head was starting to ache worse than before, he closed his eyes in frustration. He could hear a sigh from the man in front of him, followed by more scribbling. 

“Who is Brint?”

Brint’s eyes opened, he understood. “Brint is Brint.” He said it matter-of-factly. Why didn’t this man understand? Why couldn’t they understand each other?

The man scratched his head and wrote more things down before turning and walking away. Brint wanted to reach out, he wanted to yell out, the words and actions wouldn’t form. He didn’t want to be alone again in the dark. The man walked out through the light filled doorway, a moment later the door slid into place, locking Brint away again in pure darkness.
