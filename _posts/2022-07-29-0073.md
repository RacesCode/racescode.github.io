Before I approach I feel the need to scout, the more information I have the better off I'll be. I hope. I have to consider the possibility that the transmitter is rigged to implode, using the power of Aether almost nothing could escape the radius. 
I don't know what to do in this case. At least it might kill the being from the Outer Edge, the one inextricably linked to my own untethered soul. 
Sometimes I can catch glimpses of what it sees, I can form its vision in my mind. 
It's close. Prowling. Waiting. 
I saw myself once.
Not much time.
