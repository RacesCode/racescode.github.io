The Outer Edge feels like swimming through a realm of consciousness as an ethereal soul. But somehow the energy of yourself translates to a strange corporeality, you can move, see, touch. Though I have experienced this place, I cannot describe it. The ineffable quality of this existence is overwhelming. What I can describe however are my emotions, what I have felt. 

Fear.

The feeling of being hunted.
