The feeling of hunger is almost overwhelming, the desire overpowering even my own rational thoughts.
Even though these feelings are not my own.
I can still feel through the hunter that tracked me out of the Outer Edge, I can feel their desires similar to how I can sense my own disembodied emotion. The two swirl into each other, mixing and ebbing in the space of feeling I pull from. 
The cost of travelling through nonexistence has a steep cost I suppose.
