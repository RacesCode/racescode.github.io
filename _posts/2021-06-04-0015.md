The Universal Court had decided, and that was that. The manner of Kyr’s exile was thought to be complex, but truthfully it wasn’t. Though this had been the first example of a universal banishment ever recorded, the technology had been available for eons just simply waiting to be used. 

“Eat this.”

Kyr looked at the dark fuzzy mass that sat in the palm of the technician’s hand. Now feeling ill he looked pleadingly into the eyes of the man before him. The technician’s eyes repeated his previous statement well enough. Kyr breathed deep and picked the ambiguous morsel into his own hand, analyzing it. It was disgusting. The thing was covered in hair, seeping with some sort of translucent gel fluid, he felt like it was going to twitch and move. He knew arguing was pointless but holy fuck. He closed his eyes thinking it would help but he couldn’t unsee it. Eventually the courage arrived and Kyr ate it, it’s taste shattered expectations, it was worse than he could’ve imagined. He barely managed to stammer out words, trying to overcome the horrifying taste and the overwhelming pain now spreading throughout his entire body.

And then Kyr was gone.
