Khri stood on the steps of the star temple, the sky orb cradled in both hands. This was it. After hundreds of years someone from the dwellers finally had one of the powers that had made the gods so deific, one of the very things that had separated her people from the stars. She held it in her very hands. Looking into the orb she could see cracks and sparks of lightning shoot around, small flashes of light illuminating the deepness within it, streaks of mist and clouds swirling around endlessly together – it felt like she was holding the sky itself as it stormed, the vastness inside seemed incomprehensible.  

Her people had fought and died for this, suffered through centuries of enslavement. An incalculable amount of dwellers' lives thrown away. The importance of such was not lost on her, though holding this relic here and now only made her resent it. How can something so small have caused so much pain? For what? Was this orb worth her people’s lives? Her father’s life?

It took a lot for Khri not to just smash the orb – be done with it – but that would be a waste to everyone who sacrificed their lives for her to have this, she couldn’t. It didn’t change how she felt about it, but she vowed to keep it safe. She held the orb close to her heart. 

“Please Aarand, do your part,” she said, “don’t let this be in vain.”
