Irie opened the book and began to read. Had she read this book before? The surrealism of her predicament wasn’t lost upon her, the dreamlike quality of her experience here left her not questioning logically. This book was about her, she realized it after only a page. She closed the book, running her fingers over the mountain on the cover. She didn’t want to relive her past, especially now. She held the book in her hands for a second. 

How does it end?

She opened to the last page.
