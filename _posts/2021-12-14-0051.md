Memories have been imparted into my soul, physical memories of lives past and present. I can feel the breath, the heartache, the hunger. 
The desire to kill. 
It's clear to me now what hunts me. Something even a god could fear. 
I wonder if it can feel what I feel. I wonder if our souls are linked.
Can it feel my fear?
