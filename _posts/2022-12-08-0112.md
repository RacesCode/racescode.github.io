*Another day, another night,*

*another journey, another plight.*

*At the end of the road lies a scholar in black, *

*And Orel's killer in white,*

*the truth between them, lies just out of sight.*

*The forests beyond cast shadows, long and riddled with doubt,*

*they stretch and fall, a perilous hunger dances your route.*

*You have a time limiting your way,*

*may you make the best of it today.*

-unnamed beggar, Gentig Province, 1433.

*I can't tell if the beggar made up the piece or simply couldn't remember it correctly after the clear slippage of his mind. I can conclude this because the meter with which this follows is discordant and unpleasant to be frank. I can see gaps here. Unfortunately this is one of the only traces I have of Orel I can scrape up from anything in this region or era and there was no trace of him after. What did this mad man know?*
