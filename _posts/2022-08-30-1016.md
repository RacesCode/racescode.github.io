Fifteen is truly an anomaly in every sense of the word. As I pulled closer I noticed strange magnetic field patterns radiating off of the orbiting body, the force was so strong I couldn't approach. Is this something created by sentient hands? Maybe there's more at play here than just the power of Aether and how it relates to the transmitter, something I don't yet understand.
