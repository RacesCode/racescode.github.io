The planets orbiting Aether have long and complex names, XV-7372701 for example is the one I'm heading towards. I find it easier to refer to it as Fifteen. I think it's truly amazing that in this branch of the galaxy, so close to home, something like this can exist, a temperate planet that can sustain life. In other circumstances I'd be a lot more excited about Fifteen's prospect, unfortunately we find ourselves here to find the saboteur.
