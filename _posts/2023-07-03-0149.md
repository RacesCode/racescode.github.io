She could definitely walk around the perimeter of the camp but she felt she’d see nothing but pillared wall running all the way around, though it would be nice to see the scale of the place, it wasn’t worth the time investment. The most straightforward answer was finding a way to peek over the walls. That was tricky. The palisades were basically whole trunks from the trees in the surrounding area and the Holdout did not waste very much of the height on them to build their walls. It was clear they probably specifically chose the taller trees to cut down for the walls anyway. She couldn’t risk climbing the wall itself either. While it sounded obvious enough she already doubted she could climb one of the nearby trees as it was, and they had branches. Not to mention the trees afforded an added security measure of being further away if she was compromised, not right next to the wall ready to be captured or killed. She settled for a moment, watching the Hideout walls, thinking. 

Over the next half hour Ryn had decided on two different approaches. The first was to wait until dark when she could bet on someone lighting the fire in front of the gate again. She’d have to get closer which was a risk, and also wouldn’t net that much information. A weak strategy but based on the only thing she knew about this place, its firepit. Her second idea was more daring: lay a trap, send a message, bait them into opening that door but from a safe distance away. Somehow. With more and more desperation starting to build up inside of her she was nearing the point where she could see herself just walking up to the gate and knocking, begging for help. She could see the warm beds in her mind, fresh bread, and company. Just as easily the logical side of her saw weapons pointed at her, chains, torture. Death. Fortunately she wasn’t quite that desperate yet. Ryn was committed to her plans, she just needed to use the most precious resource she had to polish and execute them. Time.

Hopefully when she finally walked up to that gate and knocked it was because she was confident she wanted to be there.
