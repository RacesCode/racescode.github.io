“Why do they reside over us?” 

“Why is the sky dark. Asking dumb questions about the universe won’t help you understand how to live your life.”

“Why not?”

“Because there’s nothing you can do about it. The Gods rule over us like the wind, it just IS. You think we like being under the thumb of *them*? Growing up means learning your place – learn to control the things within your grasp and live your life. Find happiness through your own means. But don’t try to change the way life works, all you’ll find is defeat.”

“Maybe *you* just aren’t brave enough to face the consequences, to push the boundaries. Hope is a powerful thing, why smother it."

“I’m not brave, because I’m not stupid. Don’t be stupid Aarand. Hope doesn't feed the hungry."
