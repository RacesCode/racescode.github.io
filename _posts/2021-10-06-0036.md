I have met a traveller within the Outer Edge, the same as I. They told me to call them Xeno in my language. They are from a place and time I cannot comprehend but they helped show me around the spaces. Everything is much more complicated out here but also simpler. I can’t explain. It’s mind melting but I’m just electing to not think about things too much, I’m just in another place is all, make it simple.
