Sellira closed the door to her room and bolted the lock. She lingered, a hand on the frame, her mind blank. For a moment she simply *was*, nothing more. She let out a deep breath and slid down to the floor, resting her head against the wall and closing her eyes. Rest. *Finally.* 

The last few days had been draining in a way she had never really experienced, pushing the bounds of what she was capable of living through as a human being. That bastard Modin had been in a particularly sour mood as of late and for whatever reason she was in his line of sight. *Someone has to be.*

She reluctantly opened her eyes and reached to pull off her shoes. Everything ached, but especially her feet. All that walking and standing in these tight insufferable constricting little feet prisons. She threw her shoes across the room and let her head fall against the door frame again. How much more could she take? 

*Not much more.*

After some time she crawled over to her bed, a lavish looking frame with the most uncomfortable mattress in the kingdom. She reached under the nightmare of a bed and unstrapped her notebook from underneath.

“No one who ever changed the world did it while sleeping.”
