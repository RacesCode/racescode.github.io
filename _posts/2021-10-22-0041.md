I've been wandering for an unknown amount of time, it is not a concept in this place. I don't know anymore if these messages can reach you. I don't know if you still read them. I have found a way through the Outer Edge. There are two exits, I believe, that stand before me. The human mind cannot comprehend what lies beyond without plunging into the madness itself. One exit drops memories of flowers into my mind. The other sends feelings of souls rejoicing through my spine. I do not know what these mean but I am desperate to leave. I hope after all this is said and done I can find a way home.
