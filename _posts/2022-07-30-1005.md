So strange these days that have passed after travelling through the Outer Edge, everything feels so limited. Feeling, sensations, knowing. It's all so constrained. When I was there I was able to know things, beyond how we do, beyond how we feel. I find myself feeling too locked into this vessel, the detached soul clinging on wants to be unchained. 
Ridiculous is it not? A dangerous place such as that and I'm drawn to it. 
Well, one dangerous thing at a time.
